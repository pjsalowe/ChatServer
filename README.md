# ChatServer

This is a Chatserver that has one server and can run multiple clients as threads. Each client has a few features, such as:
     /msg for private messaging other clients in the server
     /list for a list of all clients in the server
     /logout to logout of the server
All features listed above are described in more detail at the top of the ChatClient.java method.

THis was made as a final project for a computer science course at Purdue University
